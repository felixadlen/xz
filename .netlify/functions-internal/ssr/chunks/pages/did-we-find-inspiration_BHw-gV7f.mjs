After our big launch three weeks ago, we’ve been in such awe of all the responses. We are totally beyond grateful for all the kind words, shares and engagement! Our journey has never been a straight line, going from point A to B, or X to Z. It’s rather been a continuous flow of different paths – learning, growing and trying new things each day. <strong>These challenges motivate us</strong>.</p>\n<p>In our previous story, we emphasized our own desire to work and live somewhere where we could become more inspired, more creative, and in the end, bring more value into our work. The first step to stop chasing inspiration, was to chase inspiration. Here are our key takeaways so far!</p>\n<h2 id=\"working-while-travelling-is-different\">Working while travelling is different.</h2>\n<p>To start off, we currently don’t have a dedicated office. This can be good, but also bad. One perk of having an office with a dedicated setup and regular 9-5 hours, working closely in a team, is that it creates a clearer distinction between work and personal life. However, it’s easy for office days to become repetitive patterns, which can sometimes be both non-motivating and uninspiring.</p>\n<p>For us, the mix of a dedicated office space, together with the flexibility of working in new surroundings when needed, might be the key. The important thing is to change the scenery, even if it’s means working from the bed, the office desk, or a café. Just have a ready-to-go setup, which we’ll talk about later on.</p>\n<div class=\"stories-quote\">\n<h3>We thought it would be nice to quit 9-5.<br>Instead we got to work 9-24..</h3>\n</div>\nAlso, since starting our own business, we haven't had any set working hours.\n<p>It probably sounds more luxurious than it is, since it most often results working until 4 am or not getting a single day off in many weeks. However, the big perk with having fluid working hours is that we can customize our days to what we need. Do we have a business meeting at 11 pm due to different time zones? Then we can go to the beach or explore the city during the day and start working in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>Finally, travelling and exploring new cities, various types of nature and different cultures is not something we otherwise do on a daily basis. Getting this many new inputs and experiences has really helped us develop, both in our business and personally.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 2rem;\">The insights</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #c83c4e\">►</span> <strong style=\"font-style: italic\">Input equals output</strong></p>\n<p>It’s easy to think that inspiration is going to hit you when the time is right.

Nonetheless, it’s good to have a couple of go-to places you know you can head over to if you need more inputs, even from your bed.
