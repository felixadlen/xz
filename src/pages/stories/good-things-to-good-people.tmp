## Sharing is caring

<!-- When we went live with XZ, it was a pure joy to see all the amazing people we had around us who shared and came with heart warming congratulations. -->

<!-- In today's digital climate, it's not a secret that it's hard to reach out through the noise. -->

It's not a secret that it's hard to reach out through the noise today.
To get something spinning, you need to work hard, be nice, and perhaps a bit of luck from all eaten fortune cookies. And of course, reach the right people at the right time.

On our launch day, over 17 people shared on different platforms, which is quite incredible due to the fact that we were completely new. Not only did it mean a lot to us personally, but also for our business.

Even though many of our friends and family aren't our targeted audience - their support might still reach to that one right person. The power of sharing today is huge, and we shouldn't oversee the affect it might have even if it's "just support from a friend".

## The genuine way to make connections

Through this altruism and kindness, we got in touch with two amazing entrepreneurs who were just starting up their business in financial consulting. Starting from scratch, they needed a full brand identity and a graphic profile that stands out in a rather busy industry. And the good news, they seemed to like us.

With two weeks to go before they went live, we put our hearts into this project and went full on work mode for two weeks straight. And let us tell you - it was a blast! Although the balinese mosquitos also seemed to love working late. We like to make good things to good people, and we got to do that.

## Geenio

The two humble founders, Emma Trygg and Vanja Istell, brings both passion and years of experience in their field, and had a clear vision from the start for the brand's core values. A brand that felt genuine, personal and trustworthy. And o'boy, did we get happy when they wanted our help.

To have that foundation from start, made our work with building a brand from scratch easier. With their main focus on making genuine connections and a vision of standing out in the industry, we got to work with creating a brand that will achieve that.

Today Geenio is officially live and ready to go connect their consultants with positions and needs within the financial field. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/geenio/" _blank>Follow them on Linkedin!</a> It's a pure joy to see them in action and we couldn't be happier that we got to be a part of the brand's visual identity. And that we have such great people around us that made it possible for us!

We strongly believe that in order to reach your goals or visions - be sure to also see and acknowledge others goals and processes as well. Sometimes we're so caught up in our own journey that we're missing out on others success.

Be kind, celebrate others victories and be generous with congratulations, likes and shares - you never know if your support today will make them reach their goals tomorrow. And that our friends, should be just as important as reaching your own goals.
